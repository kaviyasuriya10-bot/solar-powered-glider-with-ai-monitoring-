## Overview

This project presents the design and development of a solar-powered autonomous glider with AI-based monitoring capabilities. The system integrates renewable energy, embedded electronics, and flight control to enable efficient and long-endurance aerial operation.

The glider uses solar panels to supplement battery power, extending flight duration while reducing dependence on ground charging. A flight controller manages stabilization and navigation, while onboard electronics monitor system performance in real time.

## Key Features

* Solar-assisted power system for extended endurance
* Autonomous flight using Pixhawk and ArduPlane
* Real-time telemetry and system monitoring
* Lightweight fixed-wing glider design
* Modular architecture for future AI integration

---

## System Components

* **Flight Controller:** Pixhawk
* **Power System:** LiPo battery + solar panels + CN3722 MPPT
* **Sensors:** IMU, GPS, barometer, compass
* **Communication:** Telemetry module
* **Actuators:** Servo motors and brushless motor (ESC controlled)

## How It Works

Solar panels generate energy during flight and charge the battery through an MPPT controller. The flight controller processes sensor data to maintain stable flight and execute missions. Control signals are sent to servos and the motor to adjust the aircraft’s movement.
