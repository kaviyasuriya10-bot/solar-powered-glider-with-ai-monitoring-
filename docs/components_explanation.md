## Components Explanation

### Flight Controller

The Pixhawk is the main control unit of the glider. It processes sensor data and controls the aircraft’s movement by sending signals to servos and the motor. It enables stabilization, autonomous flight, and safety features.

---

### Microcontroller

The Arduino Uno R4 WiFi is used for additional tasks such as sensor monitoring, data processing, and future AI integration. It acts as a companion system to handle custom logic.

---

### Solar Panel

Flexible solar panels are mounted on the wings to generate electrical energy during flight. They help extend flight time by supplementing the battery power.

---

### MPPT Charge Controller

The CN3722 MPPT module regulates power from the solar panels and efficiently charges the battery. It ensures maximum power extraction and prevents damage from unstable solar input.

---

### Battery

A LiPo battery (typically 3S 11.1V) stores energy and supplies power to all onboard electronics, including the motor, controller, and sensors.

---

### Brushless Motor

The brushless motor provides propulsion when required. It is efficient, lightweight, and suitable for aircraft applications.

---

### ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)

The ESC controls the speed of the brushless motor based on signals from the flight controller. It adjusts motor power for takeoff, cruising, and maneuvering.

---

### Servo Motors

Servo motors control the aircraft’s movement:

* Aileron → roll control
* Elevator → pitch control
* Rudder → yaw control

---

### Telemetry Module

The telemetry system allows wireless communication between the glider and the ground station. It sends real-time data such as battery status, GPS position, and flight parameters.

---

### GPS Module

The GPS module provides location, speed, and navigation data. It enables autonomous flight modes and waypoint navigation.

---

### Camera (Optional)

A lightweight camera can be used for live video transmission (FPV) or AI-based monitoring and analysis.

---

### Thermal Sensor (Optional)

A thermal sensor measures temperature or detects heat sources. It can be used for environmental monitoring or system safety.

---

### Power Distribution Components

Includes connectors (XT60), wires, and voltage regulators. These ensure safe and efficient power delivery to all components.

---

## Summary

Each component plays a specific role in ensuring that the glider can fly efficiently, monitor its environment, and operate autonomously using solar-assisted power.
